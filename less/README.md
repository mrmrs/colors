# LESS Implementation
This folder contains a LESS implementation of colors. By using Leaner Stylesheets we can effectively reuse and manage the colors across multiple objects.

The library has been implemented using LESS 3.9.0.

## Installation Instructions
To use this implementation of colors you can directly use the `.css` or `.min.css` files. Alternatively, to compile the `.less` files you can simply use the gulp utility attached as a dependency in the `package.json` file.

First, make sure that you have node js and NPM installed on your machine. Then run the following commands:
```javascript
npm install --global gulp-cli
cd /to/less/folder
npm install
npm start
```
