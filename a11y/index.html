            Contrast is the difference in luminance or color that makes an
            object (or its representation in an image or display)

            determined by the difference in the color and brightness of the
            object and other objects within the same field of view. Because the
            human visual system is more sensitive to contrast than absolute

            Contrast is the difference in luminance or color that makes an
